## Introduction
MatoneForest is a terminal-based tool for performing bulk and specific classification tasks on LIGO glitch metadata using a random forest model. It comes pre-packaged with a default model trained on the o3a and o3b LIGO datasets but has the capacity to train and use a new model given a user-provided glitch dataset in csv format.
